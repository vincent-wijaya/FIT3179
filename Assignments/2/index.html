                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="text">Formula One is an international open-wheel single-seater formula racing which started back in 1950 which races all around the world. 
                    The word <i class="red">Formula</i> refers to a set of regulations which all participating cars must follow.
                    These regulations change season after season and together with reasearch and development, have led to the different-looking <i class="red">Formula One</i> cars
                    over the years.</p>

                        Since 1967, <i class="red">Formula One</i> have had at least 10 races each season and each race held at a different circuit in a different country.
                        Presently, they have roughly 20 races a season.

                        In 2021, it came down to the wire â€“ the final race, which was held in Abu Dhabi. It was between
                        the 7-time World Champion <b class="red">Lewis Hamilton</b>, looking to be the sole leader in
                        driver titles, or <b class="red">Max Verstappen</b> to win his maiden World Drivers' Championship title.
                        <b class="red">Max Verstappen</b> eventually edges his championship rival, <b class="red">Lewis Hamilton</b>,

                <p class="text">
                    <i class="red">Formula 1</i> cars have been improving over the years. Despite the banning of ground
                    effect since 1983, which reduced downforce, constructors have discovered other ways to go faster
                    on the track. There is a conistent decreasing trend year after year depending on the circuit. Research
                    and development on <i class="red">Formula 1</i> cars have also advanced technology of road cars.

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="text">
                        One circuit which showed an obvious yearly decrease is the <b class="red">Australian Grand Prix</b> in 
                        <b class="red">Melbourne</b>. There were a couple of outliers in 2005 and 2013 due to damp track 
                        conditions which slowed down the cars massively.

                    <p class="text">
                        Also in the <b class="red">British Grand Prix</b> in <b class="red">Silverstone</b>, there is downward trend of fastest qualifying time
                        until a circuit layout change for the 2010 season. Since the change, there was again a downward slope, despite 
                        the few peaks due to rainy qualifying sessions in 2012, 2014, and 2017.

                <p class="text">
                    Another example is the <b class="red">Austria Grand Prix</b> in <b class="red">Spielberg</b>, there is a clear 
                    trend at least from 2014-2021 where cars are qualifying quicker each year, except for the rainy
                    2015 qualifying session.
